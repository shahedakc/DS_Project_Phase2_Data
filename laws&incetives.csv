E85, fuel blends containing at least 20% biodiesel (B20), natural gas,
propane, electricity, and hydrogen. A vehicle may receive one rebate in
its lifetime. Only AFVs purchased from an Illinois-based company or
vendor may qualify, except if the vehicle is a heavy-duty specialty
vehicle that is not sold in Illinois. To qualify for a fuel rebate, the
entity or individual must purchase the majority of E85 or biodiesel fuel
from Illinois retail stations or fuel suppliers. The E85 fuel rebate is
up to \$450 per year (depending on vehicle miles traveled) for up to
three years for each flexible fuel vehicle that uses E85 at least half
the time. The biodiesel fuel rebate (for B20 and higher blends) is for
80% of the incremental cost of the biodiesel fuel, as compared to
conventional diesel. Rebates are part of the Illinois Green Fleets
Program and are available to all qualified Illinois residents,

combinations of these purposes. AFVs include vehicles capable of
operating on electricity, ethanol, propane, hydrogen and natural
gas, as defined by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct). They do
not include hybrid electric vehicles. Grant amounts range from
$2,000 to $50,000 and are determined according to the following
formulas:

* For the purchase of OEM AFVs for which the manufacturer
produces a conventionally fueled equivalent, 80% of the
incremental cost is eligible for funding.
* For the purchase of OEM AFVs for which the manufacturer does
not produce a conventionally fueled equivalent, 30% of the
overall cost of the vehicle is eligible for funding.
* For the conversion of vehicles to run on an alternative fuel,
80% of the cost of conversion is eligible for funding.
* For the purchase and installation of refueling facilities for
an alternative fuel to be used in vehicles, 50% of the facility
cost is eligible for funding.
* For the purchase and use of E85 or biodiesel in blends of 20%
or higher, 50% of the incremental cost is eligible for funding.

Project budgets may include funding from third party sources, but
the applicant itself must directly contribute at least 20% of the
project's total budget. If a grant is awarded, the applicant
will receive funds on a reimbursement basis only. Businesses,
non-profit institutions and units of local government (including

options, rate structures with financial incentives, rebates, or other
incentives that offset the cost of purchasing or installing electric
